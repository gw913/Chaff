  abstract  = "The Blue Chaffinch Fringilla teydea is one of a few Palearctic
               species for which biometric data are lacking from the field; we
               address this issue here. Blue Chaffinches were caught by mist
               net, at ten sites on Tenerife (Canary Islands), and measured.
               Data on biometrics and moult using standard methods are
               presented, and observations on mass variation in relation to
               time of day and body size are reported for the first time. Wing
               length, bill length, bill depth \& tail were greater in adults
               and first year birds than juveniles whilst tarsus and mass were
               the same. The species shows a clear sexual dimorphism in size
               except for bill length. The duration of primary moult was
               estimated to be 66 days for adults. For first year birds (in
               their second?calendar year), the mean starting date of primary
               moult was 25 days earlier than adults and was completed after
               109 days.",
